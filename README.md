🔍 Face Recognition System

Computer Vision | Python | OpenCV

📌 Project Overview

This project is a Face Recognition System that detects and recognizes human faces from images as well as live webcam video.
The system identifies known faces by comparing facial features with stored data and marks unknown faces separately.

This project helped me gain practical experience in Computer Vision, Image Processing, and Face Recognition pipelines.
